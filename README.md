# Oph

Small middleware for helping you implement server-on-client solutions with rust.

Idea initially based on [`wasm-service`](https://github.com/richardanaya/wasm-service), which presented me the whole server-on-client concept.

## Features

* Use whatever rust web framework you want!ยน
* Static hosting friendly! (Github Pages, Neocities, etc)

ยน NOTE: the rust framework of choice should support wasm, like most of them do!

## How to Use

### In Rust:
* annotate a function with `#[oph::get_response]`. The function should receive a `Request` and return a `Response`.

```
use oph;
#[oph::get_response]
fn get_oph_response(req: oph::Request) {
    oph::Response(
        oph::method::POST,
        req.uri,
        req.headers,
        "<p>This is the body</p>"
    )
}
```

this will create an exported wasm function called `__oph_function_get_response` in the final `.wasm`.

### In Javascript:
* Pass the server WASM module to the `Oph` constructor and `serve` it.

```
const server_in_wasm = await fetch("server.wasm");
const module = new WebAssembly.Module(server_in_wasm.arrayBuffer())
Oph(module).serve();
```

That's it! A service worker will then intercept all requests and forward them to `get_response`.
